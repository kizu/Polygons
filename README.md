# True CSS3-only convex polygons

![Screenshot of a megahexagon, yay!](http://kizu.github.com/Polygons/Megahexagon.png)

1. Use `overflow: hidden` on almost all blocks.
2. Use `visibility: hidden` on all blocks except the last one.
3. Use a lot of `transform: rotate(…)` to create intersections that would hide parts of your blocks.
4. Get convex polygons, that have true clickable/hoverable areas that you can use for masking images/content and create different nice shapes.

Enjoy! And don't forget to create more shapes by yourself and make pull requests ;)
